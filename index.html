    <h2>About the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        In this hands-on session, participants will explore cloud-based systems and 
        integrate advanced AI tools, including generative AI, to develop and control 
        robotic applications using the quadruped Mini Pupper (robot dog). Blending 
        theory with practical experience, participants will learn to manage robotic 
        operations from design to deployment, leveraging AWS cloud services, Python 
        programming, the Robot Operating System (ROS), and AI technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the workshop, participants will program the robot to follow a line and 
        perform dance routines synced to music of their choice. The event promises to be a 
        fun, engaging experience, designed to spark interest in robotic programming. 
        Participants will also have the chance to apply their newly acquired skills in a 
        Mini Pupper competition at the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://attend.ieee.org/stucon-2025/">IEEE R1/R2 Student Conference</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>About the Mini Pupper</h2>
    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://mangdang.store/products/mini-pupper-2">Mini Pupper</a> 
        by <a target="_blank" href="https://mangdang.store/">MangDang</a> is an affordable, 
        open-source <strong>four-legged robot priced under $1,000</strong> &mdash; making it 
        one of the most accessible quadruped platforms for education and research. 
        Despite its compact size, Mini Pupper is a fully capable robotics platform 
        that supports <strong>ROS2</strong>, computer vision, SLAM, and can be integrated 
        with <strong>Google Gemini</strong> for AI-powered interactions and natural language control.
    </p>
    <p>
        With its low cost and powerful capabilities, Mini Pupper is the ideal tool 
        for universities looking to bring hands-on AI and robotics education 
        to their students without breaking the budget.

    <h2>What You&rsquo;ll Learn</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop covers the fundamentals you need to prepare for the Mini Pupper Competition:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&bull; <strong>Cloud-Based Robotics</strong> &ndash; Using AWS cloud services for robotic applications</li>
        <li>&bull; <strong>ROS &amp; Python Programming</strong> &ndash; Setting up and working with ROS on Mini Pupper</li>
        <li>&bull; <strong>Generative AI Integration</strong> &ndash; Leveraging AI tools including Google Gemini for intelligent behaviors</li>
        <li>&bull; <strong>Line Following</strong> &ndash; Programming Mini Pupper to autonomously follow a line</li>
        <li>&bull; <strong>Dance Routines</strong> &ndash; Creating movement sequences synced to music</li>
        <li>&bull; <strong>Competition Prep</strong> &ndash; Skills for the IEEE R1/R2 Mini Pupper Competition</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What You&rsquo;ll Take Home</h2>
    <p>
        After completing this workshop, you will know exactly what is needed to 
        <strong>bring a hands-on robotics and AI class back to your university</strong>. 
        You&rsquo;ll leave with a clear understanding of curriculum structure, 
        hardware requirements, software setup, and teaching strategies to 
        <strong>train your students with interests in AI and robotics</strong> 
        using the Mini Pupper platform. Whether you plan to offer a semester-long course, 
        a weekend bootcamp, or prepare a competition team, this workshop gives you the 
        complete playbook to get started.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Should Attend</h2>
    <p>
        This workshop is designed for <strong>IEEE student branch faculty advisors</strong> 
        in Regions 1 and 2 who are preparing their student teams for the 
        IEEE R1/R2 Student Conference Mini Pupper Competition. Whether you have 
        prior robotics experience or are new to ROS and quadruped robots, this 
        workshop will equip you with the knowledge and confidence to guide your students.
